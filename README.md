# NBA-Web
## Overview
* The primary goal is to build a simple web app using the Bubble app builder that allows users to submit their own NBA rankings
* The secondary goal is to use this project as a self-paced tutorial and/or guide for my future endeavours

## Development
### Part 1: Front End (Design)
* Bubble has 2 components
  1. Visual programming --> build web app
  2. Cloud platform --> host and run web app
* Use Bubble database to display live data (i.e. create a generic version of a page, and then dynamically display database content)
* When creating a database, split larger items into separate data types in order to improve app speed (reduce the amount of content that needs to be rendered)
* Bubble elements are positioned absolutely
* Bubble pages are responsive
* Types of Bubble elements
    1. UI elements (clickable interactions)
    2. Containers
    3. Input forms (enter information)
      * text box
      * checkbox
      * upload elements
* Reusable elements --> create groups of elements

### Part 2: Back End (Database)

### Part 3: Workflow (Functionality)
* Workflow = event that runs a series of actions when triggered
* Multiple workflows stemming from the same event run independently
* Types of events
  1. Element events --> user interacts with an element
  2. General events --> not related to a specific user action
  3. Custom events
* Types of actions
  1. Account mangement
      * log in/out
      * sign up
  2. Navigation
  3. Data --> actions that read/write data
  4. Payments
  5. Plugins --> other services
  6. Elements
